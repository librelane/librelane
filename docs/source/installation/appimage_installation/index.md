# AppImage Installation

```{tip}
On Windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which we provide

On macOS, you will need a virtual machine solution of some kind. We recommend
[lima](https://lima-vm.io), but we recommend {ref}`nix-based-installation` to
take full advantage of your hardware.
