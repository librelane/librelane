# Entering the LibreLane Environment

From your terminal, simply type `~/librelane-devshell-$(uname -m).AppImage`.

Your prompt should now look kind of like this:

```console
[nix-shell:~]$ 
```

That's it! You are now inside the LibreLane environment and can run any of the
included tools.

You can test that LibreLane works correctly by running `librelane --smoke-test`.
